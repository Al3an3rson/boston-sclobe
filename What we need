This is a list of all the components we will need to run our webscraper:

1. Python
2. BeautifulSoup (webscraping application for python)
3. A website to host input/output UI
4. A script that will take an input URL from our website and read HTML off the link (ex: put in Boston globe link, 
it will read globe website)
5. A script that will implement BeautifulSoup on the HTML (prob only looking for p-tags and maybe imgs/vids)
6. A script that will re-upload the scraped HTML to our website in text format

First functional draft should do this:
1. Input URL for any Boston Globe article into our website
2. Scrape all relevant text from article
3. Re-direct you from input website to output website with all paragraphs and images in correct order

Later drafts should:
1. Basically copy the entire BosGlob article and remove the paywall
